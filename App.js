// I. Variables & Datatypes
    // A. Q + A
        // 1. How do we assign a value to a variable?
            // We use the assignment operator (=).
            // let x = 3

        // 2. How do we change the value of a variable?
            // We use the assignment operator again (=)... assuming we didn't use const to assign it in the first place.
            // let x = 5

        // 3. How do we assign an existing variable to a new variable?
            // let agent = "DiamondHands"
            // let codeName = agent

        // 4. Remind me, what are declare, assign, and define?
            // Declare creates the variable: let x
            // Assign gives the variable a value: x = 10
            // Define is both together: let x = 10

        // 5. What is pseudocoding and why should you do it?
            // Planning out your code in human language as opposed to computer language. It's easier for the humans to read.

        // 6. What percentage of time should be spent thinking about how you're going to solve a problem vs actually typing in code to solve it?
            // 70%-30%



    // B. Strings
        //For all other questions that involve writing code, you can solve them via the following instructions.
            
        //Create a variable called firstVariable
            // Assign it the value of the string "Hello World"
            
            // Change the value of this variable to some number
            
            // Store the value of firstVariablein a new variable called secondVariable
            
            // Change the value of secondVariableto any string.
            
            // What is the value of firstVariable?
            
            // Create a variable called yourNameand set it equal to your name as a string. Then, write an expression that takes the string "Hello, my name is " and the variable yourNameso that it returns a new string with them concatenated.
            // ex: Hello, my name is Jean Valjean
